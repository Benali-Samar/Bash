# Bash
Bash scripting, some basics to start ...


1. The "hello.sh" file contain a very basic test for bash synthaxe and variable uses

2. The "file-test.sh" file contain a simple function to test wether the file needed exists and writable or not,
and if not it will create it.


3. To test it just type:
    - ./hello.sh
    - ./file-test.sh hello.txt
